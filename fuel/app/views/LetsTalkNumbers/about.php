		<p>My undergraduate education was completed at Colorado State University Fort Collins. 
		My bachelors degree is in Computer Science with a specialization on Human Centered Computing.
		Human Centered Computing is a specialization of standard Computer Science that focuses 
		on Psychology and how people interact with technology. I have been accepted to the Master's degree
		program for Computer Science at CSU Fort Collins with an interest researching the medical and 
		social applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>I have many a quaint hobby that I partake in, including:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Being a game master for Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons</li>
                <li>Painting miniatures and figures for roleplaying games and tabletop wargames</li>
                <li>Fencing and other combat styles with the <a href="https://www.sca.org/"> Society for Creative Anachronism</a></li>
                <li>Playing tabletop wargames including Warhammer Fantasy 8th edition, Warhammer 40k, Warmachine, and Frostgrave</li>
                <li>Playing and designing Video Games</li>
            </ul>

		<p>I am in my final semester at CSU as a Computer Science Major. In addition,
		I have earned a minor in Mathematics. I graduated high school in 2017, thus meaning 
		I am graduating a year early. I took many AP classes and dual-enrollment,
		so I came into CSU with many credits. I look forward to graduating in Spring 2020!</p>
		<p>I first started programming in my Junior year of high school.
		Although my teacher was less-than-impressive, I really grew to love programming. 
		I decided to study computer science in college. In college my love for programming has flourished. 
		My favorite languages are Java, C++, and Python. After college,
		I plan on going into the industry as a software engineer. </p>
